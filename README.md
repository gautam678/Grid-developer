# Grid Developer Test
The program accepts user location as a pair of co-ordinates, and returns a list of the five closest events, along with the cheapest ticket price for each event.

The code adheres to the PEP8 style guide for Python.

## Assumptions
* Number of events generated by the code can be controlled by the user. Default is ten. You can change the number of event by changing the following line in `main.py`
```{python}
number_of_events = 10  # Number of events in world
```
* The world is considered to be a square. Hence a size of 10 indicates that x-axis stretches from `-10 to 10` and y-axis stretches from `-10 to 10`.
* Number of tickets in each event cannot exceed 10. This is done to maintain simplicity. You can change the number of tickets by editing the following line in `grid_developer.py` inside class World.

```{python}
numberTickets = random.randint(0, 10)
```
## Program description and arguments
The program is written in Python 2.7x . You'll need to install python before running the code.
```sh
usage: main.py [-h] [--verbose]

The program accepts user location as a pair of coordinates and returns a
list of the five closest events, along with the cheapest ticket price for each
event.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --verbose   Display events and its attributes
```
### Prerequisites
* tox
* argparse

Tox is a package that is used for unit-testing. You can skip testing by not running `tox.ini`. Argparase is a tool that captures command line arguments. In this case argparse is used to capture verbosity and toggling the information to be displayed

### Running the program

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gautam678/Grid-developer.git
cd Grid-developer
```

```sh
python main.py --verbose
```
This would display the list of events along with the expected output. You can choose to hide the details about events by ignoring `--verbose`.

```sh
Event Number:  1
Location (1, 2)
Ticket prices:  89.97 88.34 37.10 94.94 42.98 31.31 10.36 51.66 16.33

Event Number:  2
Location (-5, 2)
Ticket prices:  75.51 9.55 7.06 26.27 55.64 84.05 80.25 93.44

Event Number:  3
Location (2, 3)
Ticket prices:  32.07 21.39 53.99

Event Number:  4
Location (2, 2)
Ticket prices:  42.97 25.60 81.70 58.52

Event Number:  5

Ticket prices:  7.78 30.64 11.33

Event Number:  8
Location (1, -2)
Ticket prices:  94.38 31.63

Event Number:  9
Location (1, 8)
Ticket prices:  96.60 61.33 87.21 7.44 73.68 34.27 32.76 77.19

Event Number:  10
Location (5, -3)
Ticket prices:  28.58 93.47 61.86
```

## Expected Output

```{python, engine='sh'}
Please Input Coordinates: -5,1
Closest Events to (-5 , 1):
Event 002 - $7.06, Distance 1
Event 001 - $10.36, Distance 7
Event 004 - $25.60, Distance 8
Event 003 - $21.39, Distance 9
Event 005 - $12.59, Distance 16
```
