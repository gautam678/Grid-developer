# Grid Developer Test
The program accepts user location as a pair of coordinates and returns a list of the five closest events, along with the cheapest ticket price for each event.

The code adheres to the PEP8 style guide for Python.

## Assumptions
* Number of events generated by the code can be controlled by the user. Default is twenty. You can change the number of event by changing the following line in `main.py`

```{python}
number_of_events = 20  # Number of events in world
```

* The world is considered to be a square. Hence a size of 10 indicates that x-axis stretches from `-10 to 10` and y-axis stretches from `-10 to 10`.
* Number of tickets in each event cannot exceed 10 by default altough this option can be modified by the user. This is done to maintain simplicity. You can change the number of tickets by editing the following line in `grid_developer.py` inside class World.

```{python}
numberTickets = random.randint(0, 10)
```

## Program description and arguments
The program is written in Python 2.7x . You'll need to install python before running the code.
```sh
usage: main.py [-h] [--verbose]

The program accepts user location as a pair of coordinates and returns a
list of the five closest events, along with the cheapest ticket price for each
event.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --verbose   Display events and its attributes
```
### Prerequisites
* unittest
* argparse

unittest is a package that is used for creating test suites in python. You can skip testing by not running `python unittest.py`. Argparase is a tool that captures command line arguments. In this case argparse is used to capture verbosity and toggling the information to be displayed

## Testing the program
I have created a test suite with a small set of examples to test if the program works according to the requirements. In order to run unittests, do the following:

```python
python unittest.py
```
### Expected output
The output should be as follows:

```sh
Test for event object passed
.Test for ticket object passed
.Test for world object passed
.Test for Correct output passed
.Test for Correct output passed
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 5 tests in 0.002s

OK
```

### Running the program

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gautam678/Grid-developer.git
cd Grid-developer
```

```sh
python main.py --verbose
```
This would display the list of events along with the expected output. You can choose to hide the details about events by ignoring `--verbose`.
